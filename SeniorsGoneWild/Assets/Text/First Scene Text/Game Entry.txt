Welcome to Seniors Gone Wild. Youâ€™ve embarked in a breathtaking, tear-snatching, mom angering, chicken cooping, son of a gun adventure! 
Your mental, physical and mothers capabilities will be pushed to the utmost limits. Your sanity will be questioned. Your mother will be alerted. And your Cat will want food. 
Sit back. Relax. And enjoy the senior ride.
