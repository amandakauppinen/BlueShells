WHAT IN TARNATION, why am I in this godforsaken nursing home. I, the great John Obi Mikel (“Mikel for short”), swear to leave this nursing home and avenge my dead Hamster Dimitri.
Yeehaw! I’m gonna get me my stuff and then go and leave this hellhole. I can’t really remember what I’m missing… I’m very old and my eyes ain’t what they used to be… Maybe I need glas….!!!
Robot Nurses: ALERT ALERT!!! OLD MAN WOKE UP FROM CRYOGENIC CHAMBER, ALL NURSES ALERTED. MUST STOP HUMAN. JOB IS AT STAKE. CAUTION IS NEEDED, MAN IS EQUIPPED WITH EMOTIONS.
Mikel: God of all chickens! That don’t sound good, I better “git”. . . out of here. (Just a little pun I learned at the University of Texas. TU for life!)
There don’t seem to be that many nurses on this floor, though they’ve taken all my stuff and probably hidden all around this home. I hope my grand papi is watching over me from the heavens.
